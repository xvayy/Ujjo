          <p class="story__text">HELLO, I’M LAUREN AND AS A LIFELONG ADVENTUROUS EATER, I’VE TRIED A LOT OF CRAZY
            THINGS, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT HOT SAUCE
            IN COFFEE WAS A SANE OPTION UNTIL A FRIEND DARED ME TO TRY IT.</p>
          <p class="story__text">AND IT SUCKED.</p>
          <p class="story__text">BUT I WONDERED IF THERE WAS A WAY TO ADD SPICE TO MY COFFEE. WHEN THERE WAS NO EASY
            SOLUTION, UJJO WAS BORN.</p>
          <p class="story__text">UJJO (OOO-JOE): THE WORD FOR “FIRE” IN KONKANI, SPOKEN ON THE WEST COAST OF INDIA, IS
            AN HOMAGE AND A LOVE LETTER TO MY
            DAD, AN INDIAN IMMIGRANT WHO INSTILLED A FIRE IN MY PALATE – AND MY HEART – FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.</p>
